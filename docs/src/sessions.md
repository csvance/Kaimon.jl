# Session Management

Kaimon connects AI agents to live Julia REPLs. Each connected REPL is a **session** -- an independent Julia process with its own state, loaded packages, and working directory. Agents execute code, inspect types, run tests, and more by routing requests to a specific session.

## What Is a Session?

A session represents a single Julia REPL that has connected to the Kaimon server. Each session has:

- A unique **8-character session key** (e.g., `a3f8b2c1`) used to identify and target it.
- Its own Julia process with independent module state, variables, and loaded packages.
- A health status indicating whether it is responsive.

Multiple sessions can be connected simultaneously, allowing agents to work across different projects or environments at the same time.

## Starting a Session

There are three ways to connect a REPL, ranging from manual to fully automatic.

### Manual

Add the lightweight `KaimonGate` package and call `serve()` in any running REPL:

```julia
]add KaimonGate
using KaimonGate
KaimonGate.serve()
```

This is non-blocking — the gate runs in a background task and the REPL remains
interactive. Good for one-off connections or scripts.

### Per-project auto-connect

`Kaimon.Generate.create_startup_script(path)` writes a `.julia-startup.jl` file into a
project directory, and `Kaimon.Generate.create_repl_script(path)` an executable `repl`
launcher that loads it. Start the REPL through `./repl`, or with Julia's `--load=` flag:

```bash
julia --project --load=.julia-startup.jl
```

The generated file loads Revise and calls `KaimonGate.serve()` when KaimonGate is available
in the environment, so startup succeeds even when Kaimon is not running:

```julia
if Base.identify_package("KaimonGate") !== nothing
    try
        @eval using Revise
    catch
    end
    try
        @eval using KaimonGate
        @eval KaimonGate.serve()
    catch e
        @warn "KaimonGate failed to start" exception = e
    end
end
```

### Global auto-connect

The Config tab's **"Julia startup.jl (global gate)"** option appends the same
snippet to `~/.julia/config/startup.jl`. After that, every Julia session on
your machine auto-connects to Kaimon without any project-level setup.

Each REPL that calls `KaimonGate.serve()` registers as a separate session with its own session key.

### Managed sessions

The `start_session` MCP tool spawns Julia processes for projects in the allowed-projects list. This lets AI agents autonomously start sessions for projects they need to work on.

```
start_session(project_path="/path/to/MyProject")
# => "Session started. Session key: a3f8b2c1"

start_session()
# => Lists all allowed projects and their status
```

When a managed session starts, Kaimon:

1. Spawns a Julia subprocess via PTY (pseudo-terminal).
2. Activates the project environment and runs `Pkg.instantiate` (see [Instantiating the environment](configuration.md#Instantiating-the-environment)).
3. Loads Revise and calls `KaimonGate.serve(spawned_by="agent")`.
4. Waits up to 120 seconds for the gate connection.

The spawned process connects back as a regular gate session. It appears in the Sessions tab like any other session, but is tagged with `spawned_by: agent` to distinguish it from manually started REPLs.

To configure which projects can be spawned, see [Projects Configuration](configuration.md#projects-configuration).

### Private sessions

By default `start_session` returns the session already running for a project, so every agent working on it shares one REPL, and its globals. Evals run concurrently, and each result says when another eval overlapped it.

An agent that needs a REPL of its own passes `private=true`. It gets a session that `start_session` never hands to another agent and that automatic binding never picks for one; calling `start_session(private=true)` again returns the same session. Setting **Agent sessions** to *private* in the Config tab (`a`), or `KAIMON_AGENT_SESSIONS=private`, makes that the default for every agent.

Privacy is per MCP connection. Subagents that share their parent's connection (as Claude Code's do) are one client to Kaimon, so a parent that runs subagents in parallel should call `start_session(private=true)` once per subagent and give each its own key to pass as `ses`. The user's own REPL is never private.

## Session Routing

Every tool that executes code or inspects state accepts a `session` (or `ses`) parameter naming the session by its 8-character key:

```
ex(e="using LinearAlgebra", ses="a3f8b2c1")
run_tests(session="a3f8b2c1")
type_info(type_expr="Matrix{Float64}", session="a3f8b2c1")
```

When it is omitted, the call goes to the agent's **bound** session: the one it last named with `ses`, the one `start_session` returned to it, or the one matching its workspace root. `ping` marks it. An agent with no bound session falls through to the only connected session, never counting another agent's private one; with several connected, the server returns an error asking for a key.

!!! note "Extension runtimes are not addressable sessions"
    Extensions connect through the Gate like a session, but they are **not** REPLs
    an agent can target. They are excluded from the session list agents route to,
    cannot be reached with `ses=`, and cannot be eval'd in — their runtime is not a
    scratch REPL and its output is not visible. Targeting one explicitly returns a
    message pointing you at `start_session` for a real REPL. Extensions are managed
    on the [Extensions](extensions.md) tab instead. To work in an extension's own
    project (e.g. developing the extension), start a normal session for it with
    `start_session`.

## Viewing Sessions in the TUI

The TUI (terminal user interface) includes a **Sessions tab** that displays all connected REPLs. For each session, it shows:

- The session key.
- Connection status and health (based on periodic heartbeat checks).
- The Julia version and active project environment.

This tab provides a real-time overview of which REPLs are available for agents to target.

### Session terminal

For agent-spawned sessions, you can open an embedded terminal by selecting the session and pressing `Enter`. This opens a full-screen PTY console connected to the session's Julia REPL, allowing you to interact with it directly while the agent continues to work through MCP tools.

Press `Esc` to close the terminal overlay. The underlying Julia process and gate connection remain active — closing the terminal only dismisses the view.

### Key reference

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate session list |
| `Enter` | Open terminal for agent-spawned session |
| `f` | Filter sessions |
| `Esc` | Close terminal or filter |

## Restarting a Session

There are three ways to restart a session:

**From the agent** — use the `manage_repl` tool:

```
manage_repl(command="restart")
manage_repl(command="restart", session="a3f8b2c1")
```

**From the REPL** — call `KaimonGate.restart()` directly:

```julia
KaimonGate.restart()
```

**From the TUI** — press `r` on the selected session in the Sessions tab.

All three methods use `execvp`, which swaps the running process image without spawning a child. This means:

- The process ID stays the same.
- All Julia state is cleared (a fresh session begins).
- The session key is preserved, so agents can continue targeting the same key.
- Revise and other packages are reloaded from scratch.

Use restart when Revise fails to pick up structural changes, or when the session state has become corrupted.

## Shutting Down a Session

To cleanly disconnect a session, use the `manage_repl` tool with the `shutdown` command:

```
manage_repl(command="shutdown")
manage_repl(command="shutdown", session="a3f8b2c1")
```

This stops the session permanently. The session key is deregistered, and the REPL disconnects from the server. The Julia process exits.

## Auto-Discovery

Kaimon uses a file-based discovery mechanism. When a REPL calls `KaimonGate.serve()`, it writes a ZMQ socket file to:

```
~/.cache/kaimon/sock/
```

The Kaimon server watches this directory for new socket files. When a new file appears, the server automatically connects to the corresponding REPL and registers it as a session. When a socket file is removed (e.g., on shutdown), the session is deregistered.

This design means sessions can start and stop independently of the server -- the server discovers them as they appear.

## Session Preferences

Per-project session preferences can be configured in `~/.config/kaimon/projects.json` under the `session_prefs` key. Preferences are matched by project name (case-insensitive basename) or full path, with a `*` wildcard for global defaults:

```json
{
  "session_prefs": {
    "MyProject": {
      "mirror_repl": true,
      "allow_restart": false
    },
    "*": {
      "allow_restart": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Preference | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `mirror_repl` | Mirror agent eval output into the host REPL. Useful for seeing what agents execute in real time. |
| `allow_restart` | Whether the `manage_repl(command="restart")` command is permitted for this session. |

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for the full `projects.json` format.
