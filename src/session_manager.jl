Build the environment-variable overlay for a spawned session subprocess.

`--project=<target>` controls the active environment as usual, with KaimonGate's
own env (`pkgdir(KaimonGate)`, which carries a `Manifest.toml` pinning ZMQ)
appended so the lightweight gate is resolvable — and recompilable from source —
without requiring a global install, regardless of the target's manifest (#47).
`JULIA_PROJECT` is cleared so `--project` is the sole authority on the active env.

The `KAIMON_GATE_*` vars convey the host's identity to the standalone gate (which
doesn't load Kaimon): the user's REPL-mirror preference (so a joined session
console shows agent eval activity by default), personality emoji, and the Kaimon
version reported in the session's pong. KaimonGate's default providers read these.

    _launch_julia_exe(lc::LaunchConfig) -> String

The Julia binary a project should be launched with, in precedence order:

1. `julia_bin`, the explicit escape hatch. May be a wrapper script, so long as it forwards its
   arguments to julia. Outranks `julia_version`, including a `julia_version` juliaup could
   satisfy, because a path the user wrote down is not something to second-guess.
2. `julia_version`, resolved against the Julia running Kaimon and then juliaup's installs.
3. The Julia running Kaimon.

A requested version that isn't installed logs which Julia is being substituted rather than
failing the spawn: losing a session over a version preference costs the user more than running
on the wrong patch, and the warning names the mismatch so it is never silent. Offering to
install it is a separate, consenting step (`_maybe_offer_julia_install`).

Every spawn for a project — a session and a test run alike — resolves the binary here, so they
cannot disagree about which Julia. That matters beyond tidiness: a project's environment records
the Julia version it was resolved for, and a dependency whose `[compat]` admits a different
version per Julia resolves differently under each. Two spawns on two Julias therefore fight over
one manifest, and the loser is left with a dependency version its Julia cannot precompile.
